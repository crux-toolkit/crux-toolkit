<h1>Crux performance test</h1>

<p>
This test checks how well the Crux search tools work on a sample data
set.  The data set consists of 7243 spectra, of which 160 are 1+, 7083
are 2+ and 7055 are 3+.  Thus, there are a total of 14298 searches to
be performed.  The database is comprised of 23,932 proteins and 10.5
million amino acids, including <i>C. elegans</i> proteins plus some
common contaminants.  The test runs five different searches (comet,
and tide-search with four different score functions) using a 3.0 Da
precursor mass window, reversed peptide decoys and a fully tryptic
digest.  The searches are followed up by analysis via two different
post-processors: assign-confidence and percolator.  The performance of
each method is summarized in a plot showing the number of spectra
identified as a function of q-value threshold.</p>

<p>
You can execute the test by running the
script <code>run-performance-test.sh</code> in this directory or the
command <code>make performance-test</code> in the parent directory.
Assuming that you have gnuplot installed, then your plots should show
up in the right-hand set of plots below. First, we separate the
results by search method:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td><center>Stored plot</center></td>
<td><center>Plot resulting from your test</center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="stored-plots/comet.png"></td>
<td><img src="plots/comet.png"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="stored-plots/tide.p-value.png"></td>
<td><img src="plots/tide.p-value.png"></td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="stored-plots/tide.tailor.png"></td>
<td><img src="plots/tide.tailor.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
Next we look at the same data again, but segregated by post-processing
method:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td><center>Stored plot</center></td>
<td><center>Plot resulting from your test</center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="stored-plots/assign-confidence.png"></td>
<td><img src="plots/assign-confidence.png"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="stored-plots/percolator.png"></td>
<td><img src="plots/percolator.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
Here are some things to look for in the output:</p>

<ul>

<li>
All the series should start in the lower left corner and be
non-decreasing as the q-value threshold is relaxed.</li>

<li>
Because there are only 7243 distinct spectra, no method should ever
find more than this number of PSMs.  In practice, the best method is
likely to give &lt;3000 PSMs at a q-value threshold of 0.1.</li>

<li>
No method should diverge from the y-axis before about 1000 PSMs have been
observed.</li>

</ul>

<p>
The following plot evaluates the agreement between Tide XCorr and
Comet XCorr.  Ideally, the plot should lie on the line y=x.  Note
that this scatter plot overestimates the agreement, because it ignores
PSMs that are identified by only one of the two search tools.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="stored-plots/xcorr.png"></td>
<td><img src="plots/xcorr.comet.png"></td>
<tr>
<td><center>Stored plots</center></td>
<td><center>Plot resulting from your test</center></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The next plot is similar to the one above, except that it compares
XCorr to the refactored XCorr used in conjunction with the exact
p-value computation.  We expect the correlation to be lower in this
plot than in the Comet-versus-Tide comparison above.</p>

<tr>
<td><img src="stored-plots/xcorr.refactored.png"></td>
<td><img src="plots/xcorr.refactored.png"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><center>Stored plots</center></td>
<td><center>Plot resulting from your test</center></td>
</tr>
</table>

The next plot is similar to the one above, except that it compares
the current res-ev scores to stored res-ev scores in exact
p-value computation.  We expect the correlation to be very high in this
plot.</p>
