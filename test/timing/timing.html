    <h1>Crux timing test</h1>

    <p>
      This test runs the Crux search engines, Tide and Comet, on a
      fixed set of spectra and a fixed database, comparing the running
      time in a variety of parameter settings.  The parameters that
      are varied include</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	precursor m/z (3 Th or 10 ppm),</li>
      <li>
	fragment bin size (1 Th or 0.02 Th),</li>
      <li>
	number of threads (1 or 4), and </li>
      <li>
	(for Tide) score function (XCorr, exact p-value, or combined
	p-value).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For Tide, we use spectra that have been converted into the
      spectrumrecords format, and the database has been indexed by
      tide-index.</p>

    <p>
      Wall clock time is measured by Crux internally.</p>

    <p>
      The results are summarized <a href="results.html">here</a>.</p>
