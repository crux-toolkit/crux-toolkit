This example shows how to use the C++/Tree mapping together with XPath.
In particular, it shows how to execute an XPath query on the underlying
DOM document and then handle the result using the more convenient object
model representation. For more information on maintaining association
with the underlying DOM document, refer to Section 5.1, "DOM Association"
in the C++/Tree Mapping User Manual.

You will need the XQilla library[1] which provides XQuery and XPath 2
support on top of Xerces-C++ in order to build and run this example.

The example consists of the following files:

people.xsd
  XML Schema definition for a simple person record vocabulary.

people.xml
  Sample XML instance document.

people.hxx
people.cxx
  C++ types that represent the person record vocabulary and a set of
  parsing functions that convert XML instance documents to a tree-like
  in-memory object model. These are generated by XSD from people.xsd.

dom-parse.hxx
dom-parse.cxx
  Definition and implementation of the parse() function that parses an
  XML document to a DOM document.

driver.cxx
  Driver for Xerces-C++ 3.x.y/XQilla 2.2.x. It first calls the above 
  parse() function to parse the input file to a DOM document using 
  XQilla-provided DOM Implementation with support for XPath 2. It
  then parses the DOM document to the object model. Finally, it
  prepares and executes an XPath query on the underlying DOM
  document and then handles the result by getting back from the
  returned DOM nodes to object model nodes.

driver-2.cxx
  Driver for Xerces-C++ 2.x.y/XQilla 2.1.x. It performs the same set
  of actions as driver.cxx above. 

To run the example on the sample XML document simply execute:

$ ./driver people.xml
