This example measures the performance of parsing and serialization in
the C++/Tree mapping. It also shows how to structure your code to 
achieve the maximum performance for these two operations.

The example consists of the following files:

test.xsd
  XML Schema which describes the test vocabulary.

test-5k.xml
test-50k.xml
test-500k.xml
  Test XML documents of various sizes.

gen.cxx
  Program to generate a test document of desired size.

time.hxx
time.cxx
  Class definition that represents time.

test.hxx
test.ixx
test.cxx
  C++ types that represent the given vocabulary, a set of parsing
  functions that convert XML documents to a tree-like in-memory object
  model, and a set of serialization functions that convert the object
  model back to XML. These are generated by the XSD compiler from 
  test.xsd.

parsing.cxx
  Parsing performance test. It first reads the entire document into
  a memory buffer. It then creates a DOM parser and pre-parses and
  caches the schema if validation is enabled. Finally, it runs the
  performance measurement loop which on each iteration parses the
  XML document from the in-memory buffer into DOM and then DOM to 
  the object model.

serialization.cxx
  Serialization performance test. It first parses the XML document
  into the object model. It then creates a memory buffer into which
  the document is serialized and a DOM serializer. Finally, it runs
  the performance measurement loop which on each iteration serializes
  the object model to DOM and DOM to XML.

driver.cxx
  Driver for the example. It first parses the command line arguments.
  It then initializes the Xerces-C++ runtime and calls the parsing
  and serialization tests described above.

To run the example on a test XML document simply execute:

$ ./driver test-50k.xml

The -v option can be used to turn on validation in the underlying XML
parser (off by default). The -i option can be used to specify the
number of parsing and serialization iterations (1000 by default). For
example:

$ ./driver -v -i 100 test-500k.xml
