CodeSynthesis XSD is a W3C XML Schema to C++ data binding compiler.
It generates vocabulary-specific, statically-typed C++ mappings (also
called bindings) from XML Schema definitions. XSD supports two C++
mappings: in-memory C++/Tree and event-driven C++/Parser.

The C++/Tree mapping consists of types that represent the given
vocabulary, a set of parsing functions that convert XML instance
documents to a tree-like in-memory object model, and a set of
serialization functions that convert the object model back to XML.

The C++/Parser mapping provides parser templates for data types
defined in XML Schema. Using these parser templates you can build
your own in-memory representations or perform immediate processing
of XML instance documents.
