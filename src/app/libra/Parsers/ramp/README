RAMP is a non-sequential parser for mzXML and mzDATA instance documents.  It is also being extended to handle the emerging mzML format, by calling the PWIZ library from the Spielberg Proteomics Center.


This is the more modern version of RAMP that can:
  read the HUPO-PSI mzData XML format
  handle 64bit peaklists
  handle missing or broken mzXML indexes 
it replaces http://sashimi.cvs.sourceforge.net/sashimi/RAMP/

Note that this version of RAMP has a new API, which was needed to add the mzData read capability.  It's a simple change, RAMPFILE instead of FILE, rampOpenFile instead of fopen, etc.

Also found in this directory is the cRAMP C++ wrapper for RAMP.


2006/05/26: now requires zlib code for compression/uncompression for mzXML 3.0

2008/02/08: Historically the ramp.cpp and base64.cpp files had .c extensions, but were being treated as C++ by developers using GCC (which doesn't distinguish C from C++).  We have renamed them to .cpp to make things less confusing for MSVC developers.
