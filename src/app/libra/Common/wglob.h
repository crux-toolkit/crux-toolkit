Program       : Glob for windows                                                  
Author        : Nathan Heinecke <nate.heinecke@insilicos.com>

Glob for Windows
	Emulates basic Glob (from unix) functionality (really very basic)
	The following features of unix glob are currently unsupported:
		-Passing any nonzero value as second or third argument (will force program exit)
		-Using the same glob_t struct for multiple calls to glob (will cause memory leaks)
