dtafilter1.c - simple ways to filter .dta files
runsearch1.c - our script to run a sequest search from an mzXML file
subsetdb1.c - creates subset fasta files, reverse databases, etc
checkdb1.c - simple fasta checker that looks for duplicate headers & extra long header/definition lines

These is my little script to download protein sequence databases from UniProt:
getdb.uniprot_proteomes
