            Libra is a module within the trans-proteomic pipeline to
            perform quantification on MS/MS spectra that have multi-reagent
            labeled peptides.  More specifically, at ISB we use Libra on
            MS/MS spectra of iTRAQ labeled samples.

	The condition.xml elements and attributes (in sequential order) 
        have the following function:

	1. &#60;fragmentMasses&#62; 
	       &#60;reagent&#62; 
           specifies the m/z values to be used in the analysis.

	2. &#60;isotopicContributions&#62;
           specifies the isotopic contributions of one line to it's adjacent
           lines (specified in fractions).  
	   The order is:
		contribution of channel 1 to channel 2
		contribution of channel 2 to channel 1 and then to channel 3
		contribution of channel 3 to channel 2 and then to channel 4
		contribution of channel 4 to channel 3

	   If you do not want to apply isotopic corrections input -2.

	3. Specifies the mass tolerance. If in field one you have choosen
	   m/z = 114 and you set a mass tolerance of 1, libra would look
	   for the most intense m/z value in the interval 113 to 115.

	4. Specifies centroiding preferences.
	   0: none
	   1: mathematical average
	   2: intensity weighted average
	   For 1 and 2 a number of iterations must be specified as well.

	5. Specifies normalization preferences.
            1 ... n: corresponding m/z value in the sorted (ascending order) 
                     list of m/z values specified in field one.

            The default is channel 1 if not specified, but you'll want to specify.


	6. Specifies the level of the MS scans to use in the analysis.
	   1: MS
	   2: MS2
	   n: MSn

	7. Switch between printing the scan number or the retention time in
	   the output file.
	   Retention time can be usefull when a link to the native data is 
	   required, but the scan numbers in the mzXML format and the native
	   output from the MS instrument do not correspond.
           [NOTE: haven't checked this feature, it might not be working.]

	8. Name of output file with tab separated information (not active yet,
           default filename is quantitation.tsv)

	9. Minimum threshhold intensity (not required).  If you have low S/N spectra
           you'll want to set this to ignore noise below a certain integrated count
           for a line.

            Given conditions, Libra integrates the intensities of the 
            reagent m/z lines (a.k.a. channels throughout documentation) 
            in an MS/MS spectrum and stores the values at the peptide 
            level in the interact.xml file. ProteinProphet, within the 
            trans-proteomic pipeline, infers the simplest list of proteins 
            consistent with the identified peptides. (Note that peptides 
            with PeptideProphet probabilities less than 0.5 are excluded 
            in Libra.)

          <P style="text-align:justify;">
            Protein quantitation is derived from the group of peptides
            associated with the protein.
            Each peptide integrated intensity is normalized by the
            sum of it's channel intensities, the normalized channels
            are averaged over all peptides of a protein, the standard
            deviation of the mean is determined for each normalized
            channel of a peptide, normalized channels more than
            2 sigma from the mean are removed, the average channels
            of the protein are recalculated for those channels
            surviving outlier removing, and the 1-sigma standard errors are 
            calculated using the standard deviation.  If the user has 
            specified a reference normalization channel, the protein quantitation is
            normalized w.r.t. that channel, and the errors become
            the channel error and the reference channel error 
            added in quadrature.  
            <b>The value 99.99 </b> indicates that a protein's quantition was calculated
            using only peptide, and so the standard error is infinite.
            <b>The value -9.0 </b>indicates that no peptides of the protein survived the threshhold filter
            and outlier removal, so the protein quantitation is undefined.
            (One day, would like to use intensity weighted mean and errors in calcs.)
          </P>
          <P style="text-align:justify;">
            When a reagent m/z (channel) wasn't found in the peptide spectrum, that reagent m/z 
            is replaced with the default value.  When the intensity of a reagent line is
            less than or equal to zero,  it's value is replaced with zero.
            Note, there are still a few loose ends to tie up.
          </P>
          <P style="text-align:justify;"><sup>*</sup>
          Be wary of quantitation from very poor S/N spectra.  Is your 
          integrated intensity for a peptide channel less than 20 counts, for example?

          Please add to/edit this section.  From the table above, we can see a handful of experimental
          errors.  There may be errors in the purity of the protein purchased,
          errors in the protein concentration placed in the sample, errors in
          peptide concentration due to incomplete digestion or method of digestion,
          and errors introduced in peptide acquisition and measurement in mass spectrometer.  
          [The later measurement errors are seen as the standard deviation in the top of this document.
          These are the smallest uncertainties.]
          Guesstimating a rough accuracy in the 10 - 25% range using the expected numbers 
          and the measurements above.  This is preliminary as haven't analyzed the gazillion other
          test datasets.
          ** Note, can see above that will have difficulties with zero intensities.  For these cases, please
          check your quantitation.tsv file until have time to modify code to handle those cases...
