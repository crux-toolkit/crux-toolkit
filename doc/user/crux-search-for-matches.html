<B>Description:</B>
<br>
<br>
Given as input an ms2 file, a sequence database, and an optional parameter
file, search each spectrum against the peptides in the sequence database,
and return the resulting PSMs with some additional features in serialized
binary output files or SQT files.
<br>
<br>
<B>Usage:</B>
<br>
<br>
<code>crux-search-for-matches
  &nbsp;[options]
  &nbsp;&lt;ms2&nbsp;input&nbsp;filename&gt; 
  &nbsp;&lt;protein&nbsp;input&gt; 

</code>

<p>
<B>Input:</B>

<UL>

<LI>
&lt;ms2 &gt; &ndash; The name of the file (in MS2 format) from which
  to parse the spectra. 

<LI>
&lt;protein input&gt; &ndash; 
  The name of the file in fasta format or the directory containing a
  protein index from which to retrieve proteins and peptides.

</UL>
<B>Output:</B>

<UL>
<p>
  The program writes to a user-specified folder a binary file
  that contains the PSMs and additional features.
  </p>
<p>
  Optionally, the result can be output in a human readable
  SQT format file instead of or in addition to the binary file.
  </p>

</UL>
<B>Options:</B>
<UL>

<li>
[--use-index &lt;T | F&gt;] Use an index that has already been 
    created if true (T) or use a fasta file if false (F). When using
    an index the 'protein input' argument will be the name of the
    directory containing the index files (the same as the 'index name'
    argument for crux-create-index).  Default = F.

<LI>
[--output-mode &lt;sqt | binary | all&gt; ] &ndash; The output
format. In 'binary' mode the output file is named after the input MS2
file with extension .csm and the file(s) with search results from
decoy sequences end in -decoy.csm.  The binary output files become the
input for crux-analyze-matches.  In 'sqt' mode only a text file is
produced.  It's name is controlled with the --sqt-output-file and 
--decoy-sqt-out-ut-file options.  With 'all' both binary and text 
files are produced. Default = binary.

<LI>
[--match-output-folder &lt;string&gt;] &ndash; The direcotry in
which to store the binary output files and/or text sqt files. Default
= current directory.  

<li>
[--overwrite &lt;T | F&gt;] Replace existing files if true (T) or 
fail when trying to overwrite a file if false (F). Default =  F.

<LI>
[--sqt-output-file &lt;string&gt;] &ndash; Name of the output text
file.  Only works with --output-mode&lt;sqt | all&gt; Default = target.sqt.

<LI>
[--decoy-sqt-output-file &lt;string&gt;] &ndash; Name of the output
sqt file for matches to decoy (shuffled) sequences.  Only
relevant with --number-decoy-sets &lt;1 | 2&gt;.  With two decoy
sets, only one is printed to an sqt file. Default = decoy.sqt.

<LI>
[--number-decoy-set &lt;0 | 1 | 2&gt;] &ndash; Specify the number
of decoy sets to generate for match_analysis. At least one decoy set
is required to run the algorithm 'percolator' in a subsiquent
crux-analyze-matches run.  Default = 2. 

<LI>
[--prelim-score-type &lt;sp | none&gt;] &ndash; The type of preliminary 
scoring function to use.  In the preliminary scoring step, all
possible psms for a spectrum are scored and sorted by score.  Only the
top ranking psms are retained for the second scoring step. The
parameter file option 'max-rank-preliminary' controls how many
top-ranking psms are retained.  Default = sp.

<LI>
[--score-type &lt;xcorr | sp | xcorr-pvalue | sp-pvalue&gt;]&ndash; 
The type of scoring function to use in the second scoring step.  Xcorr
is the SEQEUST-style score, sp is the SEQUEST-style preliminary
scoring function.  A p-value for each psm can be calculated from
either the xcorr score or the sp score with 'xcorr-pvalue' and
'sp-pvalue', respectively. Either one may be used with the
crux-analyze-matches 'curve-fit' algorithm.  Using xcorr or sp
followed by the crux-analyze-matches algorithm curve-fit results in
unspecified behavior.  Default = xcorr.

<LI>
[--spectrum-min-mass &lt;float&gt;] &ndash; The lowest spectrum 
m/z to search in the ms2 file. Default = 0.0

<LI>
[--spectrum-max-mass &lt;float&gt;] &ndash; The highest spectrum 
m/z to search in the ms2 file. Default = no maximum.

<LI> 
[--spectrum-charge &lt;1 | 2 | 3 | all&gt;] &ndash; The spectrum 
charges to search. With 'all' every spectrum will be searched and
spectra with multiple charge states will be searched once at each
charge state.  With 1, 2, or 3 only spectra with that charge will be
searched. Default = all. 

<LI>[--parameter-file &lt;filename&gt;] &ndash; A file containing
command-line or additional parameters.  See the <a
href="parameter-file.html">parameter documentation</a> page for
details.

<LI>
[--write-parameter-file &lt;filename&gt;] &ndash; Create a file
with the name and value of all parameters/options for the current
search.  Not all parameters in the file may have been used in the
search.  The resulting file can be used with the --parameter-file
option for other crux programs. 

<LI>
[--verbosity &lt;0-100&gt;] &ndash; Specify the verbosity of the
current processes. Each level prints the following messages, including
all those at lower verbosity levels: 0-fatal errors, 10-non-fatal
errors, 20-warnings, 30-information on the progress of execution,
40-more progress information, 50-debug info, 60-detailed debug info.
Default = 30.

<li>
[--version T] &ndash;
Print the version number and quit.  Please note that you must include
the 'T' after --version.

</UL>
<B>Parameter file options:</B>
<ul>
<li>
[fragment-mass &lt;average | mono&gt;] &ndash; Which isotopes to use
in calcuating fragment ion mass (average, mono). Default mono.

<li>
[ion-tolerance&lt;float&gt;] &ndash; Tolerance used for matching
observed peaks to predicted fragment ions.  Default 0.5.

<li>
[max-rank-preliminary &lt;int&gt;] &ndash;  Number of psms per
spectrum to score after preliminary scoring.  Default 500.

<li>
[top-match &lt;int&gt;] &ndash; The number of psms per spectrum writen
to the binary output file. Only relevant when
output-mode=&lt;all|binary&gt;. Does not affect output to text files.
If more than one psm is written to file, the matches for each spectrum
will be re-ranked in crux-match-analysis. Default 1.

<li>
[max-sqt-result &lt;int&gt;] &ndash; Number of search results per
spectrum to report in the sqt file. Only relevant when
output-mode=&lt;all|sqt&gt;.  Does not affect output to binary
files. Default 5. 

<li>
All options used by crux-create-index will be used by
crux-search-for-matches when the protein input is a fasta file (not
index).  This includes all parameters that control which peptides are
generated and how masses are calculated.
