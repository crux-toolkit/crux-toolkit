<h1 align=center>Crux Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<ol>

<li>
<b>How does Crux compute the masses of peptides and peptide
  fragments?</b></li>

<p>
<ul>

<li>
Each amino acid can be characterized either by its monoisotopic mass,
which is the mass of the most common isotopic form of that amino acid,
or the average mass, which is a weighted average of the masses of all
the isotopic forms.  By default, Crux uses average mass to calculate
peptide masses, though this can be controlled by the
<code>--isotopic-mass</code> option to <code>crux create-index</code>.
For fragments, Crux always uses the monoisotopic mass.</li>

<li>
The neutral mass of a peptide is not the sum of the masses of its
amino acids.  The C-terminus (i.e., the suffix, or y-ion) of the
peptide has an additional water group, whose mass is either
18.010564684 Da (monoisotopic) or 18.0153 Da (average).  Note that,
for cleavage ions, this additional mass should be added to the mass of
a y-ion, but not to a b-ion.</li>

<li>
By default, Crux adds a static modification of 57.021464 Da to all
cysteines.  This is because in most protein preparation protocols
the peptides are alkylated with iodoacetamise, resulting in 
carbidomethylation of cysteine. The alkylation step prevents the 
reformation of disulfide bonds.  Other alykylation reagents may be
used, in which case the appropriate mass shift can be specified with the
<code>C=[mass]</code> option.  Set <code>C=0</code> for no
modification.
</li>

<li>
A charged peptide has an additional approximately 1 Da mass for each
charge, corresponding to the mass of a hydrogen atom.  The exact mass
to be added depend on whether we are using the monoisotopic mass
(1.0078246) or average mass (1.00794).</li>

</ul>
</p>

<li>
<b>How does Crux estimate the possible charge states of the peptides when the
   information is not provided within the spectra file?</b>
</li>

<p>
Crux calculates the ratio of two values: (1) the sum of the
intensities from the peaks in the fragmentation spectrum whose m/z is
greater than the precursor m/z versus (2) the sum of the peaks whose
m/z is smaller than the precursor.  If this ratio is greater or equal
to a calculated threshold based upon the location of the precursor m/z
and the max m/z in the spectrum, Crux then assigns both +2 and +3 as
possible charge states to the spectrum.  Otherwise, Crux assigns +1 as
the charge state.  The algorithm is based upon the observation that
fragmentation spectra collected from peptides with charge greater than
+1 should have many more peaks that are greater than the precursor
m/z.
</p>

<li>
<b>What operating systems does Crux work with?</b></li>

<p>
Crux is written in C++, so in principle it should work on virtually
any modern operating system.  We provide pre-compiled binaries for
Linux, MacOS and Windows.  The latter requires that you have Cygwin
installed.</p>

<li>
<b>I thought Crux was supposed to be fast, but I am seeing very slow
  search speeds.  What's going on?</b></li>

<p>
Crux is not particularly optimized to run quickly on a FASTA file.  To
get Crux to go fast, you must do the <code>crux create-index</code>
step first, and then run your searches using the resulting index.  If,
after doing this, you are still getting slow search speeds, it may be
because you are using the Network File System (NFS).  Crux uses a
memory mapping mechanism that often works poorly over a system like
NFS.  The solution is to copy your index to a local disk.  Then Crux
should run much more quickly.</p>

<li>
<b>How does Crux select candidate peptides from the database?</b></li>

<p>
Crux selects candidate peptides for each spectrum based on its
precursor singly charged mass (m+h) or the mass-to-charge (m/z) and an 
assumed charge state (specified in the input file).  If the m+h and charge is 
provided in the input file (from the Z lines), then the precursor mass 
is calculated from the m+h minus the mass of a proton. Otherwise, the 
precursor mass is calculated from the precursor m/z and an assumed charge. 
A mass window is defined in one of three ways based on the 
<code>precursor-window-type</code> and <code>precursor-window</code> options.
<ul>
<li>  
If the <code>precursor-window-type</code> is set to <code>mz</code>,
then the window is calculated as spectrum precursor m/z &plusmn;
<code>precursor-window</code> and the resulting range is converted
to mass using the charge state with the formula:<br>  
Mass=m/z * charge - MASS_PROTON * charge, where MASS_PROTON=1.00727646677
</li>

<li>
If the <code>precursor-window-type</code> is set to <code>mass</code>, then
the window is defined as the precursor mass &plusmn; 
<code>precursor-window</code>.
</li>

<li>
If the <code>precursor-window-type</code> is set to <code>ppm</code>
(parts per million), then the window spans from the 
precursor mass / (1.0 + window * 1e-6) to precursor mass / (1.0 - window * 1e-6).</li>
</ul>
Candidate peptides are those whose mass falls within the defined
window.  The peptide mass is computed as the sum of the average amino
acid masses plus 18 Da for the terminal OH group.  Candidate peptides can also be constrained by minimum and
maximum allowed length. </p>

<p>
Peptides are selected from protein sequence given either in a fasta
file or a fasta file that has been indexed by <a href="crux-create-index.html">
<code>crux create-index</code></a>.  The options <code>enzyme</code>, 
<code>digestion</code> and <code>missed-cleavages</code> define how
the proteins are broken up into peptides.  When <code>enzyme</code> is
set to <code>no-enzyme</code> then any subsequence of a protein may be
considered as a candidate peptide, and the options <code>digestion</code>
and <code>missed-cleavages</code> are not used.  For other values of
<code>enzyme</code>, the residues at the termini of the protein
subsequence must follow specific rules.  For example, trypsin requires
that the preceeding residue must be an R or K and the following
residue may not be a P.  When <code>digestion</code> is set
to <code>full-digest</code>, then these rules must be true at both ends of the
peptide.  When it is <code>partial-digest</code>, then the rules must be true
at at least one of the ends.  If <code>missed-cleavages</code> is set
to false, then no cleavage site may lie within the peptide sequence;
alternatively, if true then any number of sites may lie within the
peptide sequence. </p>

<li>
<b>How can I search my ITRAQ data?</b></li>

<p>
ITRAQ and other tagged seaches can be done by using terninal
modifications.  For example, if your tag has a mass of 304.199040, add
these lines to your parameter file:
<pre>
nmod=304.199040:-1
cmod=304.199040:-1
</pre>
<p>
Crux will then generate peptides with this modification (+304.199904)
on the n-terminus, the c-terminus and on both termini.  The -1 in the
option means to add the modification regardless of where the peptide
terminus lies relative to the rest of the protein.

<li>
<b>How does Crux differ from SEQUEST<sup>&reg;</sup>?</b></li>

<p>
SEQUEST<sup>&reg;</sup> has split into at least four different development threads:
(1) the version developed in the Yates lab, initially at the
University of Washington and later at Scripps, (2) the version maintained
by Thermo Scientific, (3) the version mainted by Sage-N, and (4) the
version maintained in the MacCoss lab at the University of Washington.
Crux is based on the Yates lab development thread, SEQUEST<sup>&reg;</sup> version 28,
whose last documented modification is dated 8/16/99.</p>

<p>
The original Crux search code was an imperfect reimplementation of
SEQUEST<sup>&reg;</sup> 28.  The imperfection arose because, to avoid
copyright infringement, Crux was reverse engineered from the
SEQUEST<sup>&reg;</sup> binary; i.e., the Crux developers did not have
access to the SEQUEST<sup>&reg;</sup> source code.  The reverse
engineering continued until the developers deemed the remaining
differences to be of negligible importance.  A quantitative comparison
of the scores computed by Crux and SEQUEST<sup>&reg;</sup> can be seen
in
the <a href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/papers/park2008rapid.html">original
Crux paper</a>.  The differences between Crux and
SEQUEST<sup>&reg;</sup> v28 are comparable in magnitude to the
differences between different versions of SEQUEST<sup>&reg;</sup>.</p>

<p>
Currently, the default behavior for
the <code>search-for-matches</code> command differs in two systematic
ways from the original behavior of SEQUEST.<p>
<ul>
<li>
Originally, SEQUEST ranked candidate peptides (i.e., peptides that lie
within the user-specified precursor window) initially according to a
preliminary score called "Sp."  Subsequently, the top 500 matches were
re-scored using XCorr.  Crux can compute the Sp score, but does not
use it as an initial filter.</li>
<li>
The SEQUEST theoretical spectrum used to compute XCorr includes two
flanking peaks on either side of each b- and y-ion. Crux does not
include these peaks by default, though they can be turned on using the
"use-flanking-peaks" parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<li>
<b>How is the theoretical spectrum for a peptide generated?</b></li>

<li>
<b>In the calculation of XCorr, what preprocessing steps does the
observed spectrum undergo prior to comparison with the theoretical

-->

<li>
<b>What enhancements to Crux are planned?</b></li>

<p>
<ul>

<li>
Speeding up variable modification search by storing modified peptides
in the index.</li>

<li>
Support for searching for post-translational modifications in 
<code>search-for-xlinks</code>.</li>

<li>
Allow users to specify variable modifications of specific N-term or
C-term residues.</li>

<li>
Add support for multiple cores.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<li>
<b>How can I contribute to Crux?</b></li>

<p>
Please email crux-support@uw.edu to obtain read-only access to our
Subversion repository, along with access to our development team web
pages.  Patches implementing new features can then be emailed to the
development team for review and inclusion in subsequent releases of
Crux.</p>

<li>
<b>Where does the name "Crux" come from?</b></li>

<p>
Thin air.  The name is not an acronym or a reference to anything in
particular.</p>
