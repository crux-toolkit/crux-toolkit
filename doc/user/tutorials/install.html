		<h2>Crux Installation Instructions</h2>

		<p/>
		This page will walk you through the steps of
		installing <span class=prog>Crux<span/> on your computer.
		Separate sections describe the installation for 
		<a href="#LINUX">Linux</a>,
		<a href="#OSX">OS X</a>,
		and
		<a href="#WINDOWS">Windows</a>.
		You have the choice of installing pre-compiled binaries or building
		Crux from the source code.
		The compiled binaries offer the easiest installation option.  

		<a name="LINUX"></a>
		<h3>Linux</h3>
		<b>Note:</b> when typing the commands shown in these instructions
		do not type the
		leading <code>$</code> before each command; it indicates the
		prompt. These instructions will refer to your home directory as
		<code>$HOME</code>.  You can type <code>$HOME</code> in the commands
		or you can use the fully qualified path to your home directory which
		may be something like <code>/home/yourname/</code>.  Note that you can
		find out the location of your home directory by logging in and
		typing <code>pwd</code> or <code>echo $HOME</code>.
		<h3>Installing Pre-compiled Crux Binaries on Linux</h3>
		<ul>
    <li>Current versions of Crux require that version 2.17 of the C
    runtime library be installed.
    You can determine which version of the C runtime library is installed
    by running
		<div class=code><code>
    ldd --version
    </div>
		<p/>
    </li>
		<li><b>Download the files</b> 
		<p/>
		<span class=prog>Crux</span> is freely
		available for download under an
		<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.  
		On the download page click on the link "Linux [architecture]
		Build (zipped)" to download them to your computer.
		If your computer is running a 32-bit version of Linux select the
		i686 version.
		If your computer is running a 64-bit version of Linux select the
		x86_64 version.
		If a window pops
		up, select the "Save" button.
		To check that the file was
		transfered correctly, run this command

		<div class=code><code>
		$ md5sum <i>[downloaded file]</i></code>
		</div>
		<p/>
		and compare the output to the "MD5 checksum" link next to the file you
		downloaded.  
		<p/>
		</li>

		<li><b>Unpack and install the files</b>
		<p/>
		The file you downloaded
		should be named something like 
		<span class=file>crux-x.xx-XXXX-GNU-Linux.zip</span>
		where <span class=file>x.xx</span>
		is replaced with the most current release version
		and 
		<span class=file>XXXX</span> is either i686 or x86_64.
		Move this file 
		to a convenient location and unpack the file with this command:

		<div class=code><code>
		$ unzip crux-x.xx-XXXX-GNU-Linux.zip</code>
		</div>
		<p/>
		You should now have a new directory,
		<span class=file>crux-x.xx-XXXX-GNU-Linux</span>,
		with two subdirectories, <span class=file>bin</span> and <span
		class=file>doc</span>.  The <span class=prog>crux</span> programs are
		in the <span class=file>bin</span> directory. You may want to move 
		these files somewhere
		more convenient for you, but otherwise, that completes the
		installation!  Skip ahead to 
		<a href="#linux_path">Setting the PATH on Linux and OS X</a>
		for notes on how to run the executables.

		<h3>Building Crux From Source on Linux</h3>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Prerequisites</b>
		<p/>
		To build Crux from source on Linux you must have installed the
		following software:
		<ul>
		<li><code>gcc</code></li>
    <li><code>version 2.17 or later of the C runtime libraries</code></li>
		<li><code>g++</code></li>
		<li><code>cmake</code> (version 3.6 or later recommended)</li>
		<li><code>make</code></li>
		<li><code>git</code></li>
		<li><code>svn</code></li>
		</ul>
		<p/>
		Building <span class=prog>crux</span> also requires the
		<a href="http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net"><span class=prog>Proteowizard</span></a>
		and 
		<a href="http://percolator.ms"><span class=prog>Percolator</span></a>
		libraries. 
		These will automatically be copied from the <span class=prog>Proteowizard</span>
		and <span class=prog>Percolator</span>
		repositories and statically linked into <span class=prog>crux</span>.

		<li><b>Download the files</b> 
		<p/>
		The <span class=prog>Crux</span> source is freely
		available for download under an
		<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.  
		On the download page click on the link "Source (tarred, gzipped)",
		and choose save to disk if prompted. 
		To check that the file was
		transferred correctly, run this command

		<div class=code><code>
		$ md5sum <i>[downloaded file]</i></code>
		</div>
		<p/>
		and compare the output to the "MD5 checksum" link next to the file you
		selected on the Crux download page.  
		<p/>
		The file you downloaded should be named something like 
		<span class=file>crux-x.xx.source.tar.gz</span>, 
		where <span class=file>x.xx</span>
		is replaced with the most current release version.
		<li><b>Unpack the files</b>
		<p/>
		Move the downloaded file to a
		convenient location and unpack it with this command.

		<div class=code>
		$ tar -zxvf crux-x.xx.Source.tar.gz
		</div>
		A new directory named <span class=file>crux-x.xx.Source</span> will be
		created and a long list of files will stream by as they are being put
		into the new directory.
		<p/>
		</li>

		<li><b>Configure the build</b> 
		<p/>
		Move into the <span class=file>crux-x.xx.Source</span>
		directory from step 1.
		Run the command
		<div class=code><code>
		cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=&lt;install directory&gt; .
		</code>
		</div>
		<p/>
		where <span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span> is
		the location where you wish to install the <span class=prog>crux</span> programs. 
		If you want <span class=prog>crux</span> to go in <span class=file>$HOME/bin</span>,
		then <span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span> would be <span class=file>$HOME</span>.
		The installation process will automatically put the programs in a directory called
		<span class=file>bin</span>.
		<p/>
		Note, this configuration will build with optimizations turned on,
		and will not include debug symbols.
		To build with optimizations turned off,
		and debug symbols included,
		use the command:
		<div class=code><code>
		cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=&lt;install directory&gt; .
		</code>
    </div>
    <p/>
    To build a 32-bit version of Crux on a 64-bit machine use the <span
    class=file>-DBUILD_32=ON</span> option for CMake:
		<div class=code><code>
		cmake -DBUILD_32=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  .
		</code>
		</div>
		</li>
		<p/>
		<li><b>Build and install</b>
		<p/>
		To complete the process, run these two commands.</li>
		<div class=code><code>
		$ make<br>
		$ make install
		</code>
		</div>
		<p/>
		The <span class=prog>crux</span> programs are
		in the <span class=file>bin</span> subdirectory
		of the
		<span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span>
		That completes the installation!  Skip ahead to 
		<a href="#linux_path">Setting the PATH on Linux and OS X</a>
		for notes on how to run the executables.
		</ul>
		<a name="OSX"></a>
		<h3>OS X</h3>
		<span class=prog>Crux</span> requires OS X Yosemite or later.
		<p/>
		<b>Note:</b> 
		when typing the commands shown in these instructions do not type the
		leading <code>$</code> before each command; it indicates the
		prompt. These instructions will refer to your home directory as
		<code>$HOME</code>.  You can type <code>$HOME</code> in the commands
		or you can use the fully qualified path to your home directory which
		may be something like <code>/home/yourname/</code>.  Note that you can
		find out the location of your home directory by logging in and
		typing <code>pwd</code> or <code>echo $HOME</code>.
		<p/>
		To install and use <code>crux</code> on OS X
		you'll need to be familiar with the <span class=code>Terminal</span>
		application.
		<h3>Installing Pre-compiled Crux Binaries on OS X</h3>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Download the files</b> 
		<p/>
		<span class=prog>Crux</span> is freely
		available for download under an
		<a href=""http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>Apache 2.0 license</a>.  
		On the download page click on the link "OS X x86_64 Build (zipped)" 
		to download them to your computer.
		If a window pops
		up, select the "Save" button.
		To check that the file was
		transferred correctly, run this command

		<div class=code><code>
		$ md5 <i>[downloaded file]</i></code>
		</div>
		<p/>
		and compare the output to the "MD5 checksum" link next to the file you
		downloaded.  
		<p/>
		</li>

		<li><b>Unpack and install the files</b>
		<p/>
		The file you downloaded
		should be named something like 
		<span class=file>crux-x.xx.Darwin.x86_64.zip</span>
		where <span class=file>x.xx</span>
		is replaced with the most current release version.
		Move this file 
		to a convenient location and unpack the file with this command.

		<div class=code><code>
		$ unzip crux-x.xx.Darwin.x86_64.zip</code>
		</div>
		<p/>
		You should now have a new directory,
		<span class=file>crux-x.xx.Darwin.x86_64</span>,
		with two subdirectories <span class=file>bin</span>, and <span
		class=file>doc</span>.  The <span class=prog>crux</span> programs are
		in the <span class=file>bin</span> directory. You may want to move 
		these files somewhere
		more convenient for you, but otherwise, that completes the
		installation!  Skip ahead to

		</ul>
		<h3>Building Crux From Source on OS X</h3>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Prerequisites</b>
		<p/>
		To build Crux from source on OS X you must have installed the
		following software:
		<ul>
		<li><code>OS X Yosemite or later</code></li>
		<li><code>XCode between 6.3.1 and 10.1 (inclusive)</code></li>
		<li><code>XCode Command Line Tools</code></li>
		<li><code>cmake</code> (version 3.6 or later recommended)</li>
		<li><code>make</code></li>
		<li><code>git</code></li>
		<li><code>svn</code></li>
		<li><code>gnutar</code> (Apple's version of tar is incompatible with GNU's
    version of tar)</li>
		</ul>
		<p/>
		Building <span class=prog>crux</span> also requires the
		<a href="http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net"><span class=prog>Proteowizard</span></a>
		and 
		<a href="http://percolator.ms"><span class=prog>Percolator</span></a>
		libraries. 
		These will automatically be copied from the <span class=prog>Proteowizard</span>
		and <span class=prog>Percolator</span>
		repositories and statically linked into <span class=prog>crux</span>.
		<p />
		Building <span class=prog>Crux</span> on OS X requires a current version of
		<span class=prog>XCode</span>, and the XCode command line tools.
		Earlier versions of <span class=prog>Crux</span> 
		had to be built using the GCC compilers.
		which are no supported by Apple.
    If you have the both the GCC and Apple compilers installed, you'll need to
    adjust the <span class=prog>PATH</span> environment variable so that the
    Apple compilers are found first.
    Alternatively, you can specify which compilers should be used by setting
    the <span class=prog>CC</span>, and <span class=prog>CXX</span>.
    For example,
		<div class=code>
    <code>
    export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
    <br />
    export CXX=/usr/bin/g++
    </code>
		</div>
		<p/>
		The programs
		<span class=prog>gnutar</span>,
		<span class=prog>cmake</span>,
		<span class=prog>git</span>,
		and
		<span class=prog>svn</span>
		can be installed from 
		<a href="https://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>
		or 
		<a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>.

		for notes on how to run the executables.
		</ul>

		<a name="linux_path"></a>
		<h3>Setting the PATH on Linux and OS X</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<p/>
		On Linux and OS X systems you can always run any of the programs by specifying its full
		path.  For example,</p>

		<div class=code><code>
		$ <em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em>/bin/crux comet</code>
		</div>

		<p>In this final step of the installation, we'll set things up so that
		you can also run any of the programs by just typing its name.  This is
		done with an environment variable called <span
		class=code>$PATH</span>.  <span class=code>$PATH</span> is a list of
		places that the computer looks for executable programs.  Find out what
		is in the current list with this command:

		<div class=code><code>
		$ echo $PATH</code><br>
		</div>
		<p>The value returned might look something like this:
		<code>
		/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games
		</code>
		<p>The first directory in this colon-separated list, <span
		class=out>/usr/local/bin</span>, is the first place the computer looks
		for a program.  If it doesn't find the program there it tries <span
		class=out>/usr/bin</span> and so on down the list.  You can either
		move the crux executable files into one of these directories already
		in your PATH, or you can add <span
		class=code><em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em></span> to PATH with this
		command.  (Remember to replace the word <em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em> with the
		actual location of your installation)</p> 

		<div class=code><code>
		$ export PATH=$PATH:&lt;install directory&gt;/bin</code>
		</div>

		<p>Try '<span class=code>echo $PATH</span>' again to see that the
		change was made.  <em>&lt;install directory&gt;/bin</em> should be at the end of the
		list.  Now you can 
		run the <span class=prog>crux</span> programs by just typing their
		names.  Try this.</p>

		<div class=code><code>
		$ crux comet</code>
		</div>

		<p>The change to <span class=code>$PATH</span> is only temporary.  As
		soon as you close the window, the change will disappear.  In order to
		make the change every time you log on, add the line <span
		class=code>export PATH=$PATH:&lt;install directory&gt;/bin</span> to the file <span
		class=out>.bashrc</span> located in your home directory.  You will
		have to log on again for the change to take effect.

		<b>Open the command line development environment.</b>
		<p/>
		Under the "Start" button
		open the "Visual Studio 2017" folder, then open the "Visual Studio Tools"
		folder, and double-click on "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017".
		This will launch a 
		<span class=file>cmd</span> shell configured to use the 
		Microsoft development tools.
		</li>
		<li><b>Configure</b> 
		<p/>
		In the <span class=file>cmd</span> shell  you just opened,
		move into the <span class=file>crux-x.xx.Source</span>
		directory from step 1.
		Run the command
		<div class=code><code>
		cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=&lt;install directory&gt; -G "Visual Studio
		15 Win64" .
		</code>
		</div>
		<p/>
		where <span class=file>&lt;install directory&gt;</span> is
		the location where you wish to install the <span class=prog>crux</span> programs. 
		Note that, somewhat confusingly, Visual Studio 2017 is version 15.
		<p/>
		If you wish to disable support for vendor specific file formats,
		use this command instead
		<p/>
		<div class=code><code>
		cmake 
		-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=&lt;install directory&gt; -DINCLUDE_VENDOR_LIBRARIES=FALSE -G "Visual Studio 15 Win64" .
		</code>
		</div>
		<p/>
		<li><b>Build and install</b> 
		<p/>
		To complete the process run the commands</li>
		<div class=code><code>
		cmake --build . --config Release --target ALL_BUILD
		<br/>
		cmake --build . --config Release --target INSTALL
		</code>
		<p/>
		Once you've run the configuration step
		you can also build and debug Crux from within the Visual Studio IDE.
		CMake will generate a file named
		<span class=file>crux.sln</span>. 
		Open this file in Visual Studio.
		You can select the build configuration: Release or Debug
		in the combo box under the menu bar.
		<p/>
		<b>Note</b> The Crux build will not automatically generate
		debugging symbols even if you've selected the Debug configuration.
		Right click on the Crux folder in the "Solution Explorer" and
		select "Properties" from the pop-up menu.
		In the "Properties" page select the "Debugging" item under the "Linker"
		properties. Set "Generate Debug Info" to "Yes".
		<p/>
		Changes made to the Visual Studio solution and project files will be lost
		the next time CMake regenerates the project.

		<h3>Setting the PATH on Windows</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
		On Windows systems you can always run any of the programs by specifying its full
		path.  For example,</p>

		<div class=code><code>
		C:\<em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em>\bin\crux comet</code>
		</div>

		<p>In this final step of the installation, we'll set things up so that
		you can also run any of the programs by just typing its name.  This is
		done with an environment variable called <span
		class=code>PATH</span>.  <span class=code>PATH</span> is a list of
		directories that the computer looks for executable programs.  Find out what
		is in the current list with this command:
		<p/>
		<div class=code><code>
		C:\echo %PATH%</code><br>
		</div>
		<p/>
		<p>The value returned might look something like this:
		<p/>
		<div class=code><code>
		<code>
		C:\Windows;C:\Windows\system32;c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual 
		Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\;c:\Program Files\Microsoft 
		Visual Studio 10.0\VC\BIN;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\
		Windows Live;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\S
		ystem32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;c:\Program files\Notepad++;C:\Program Files\Tort
		oiseSVN\bin;C:\Program Files\Windows Live\Shared;C:\Program Files\CMake 2.8\bin;
		C:\Program Files\PuTTY;C:\Program Files\Subversion\bin;C:\GnuWin32\bin;
		</code>
		</div>
		<p>The first directory in this semicolon-separated list, <span
		class=out>C:\Windows</span>, is the first place the computer looks
		for a program.  If it doesn't find the program there it tries <span
		class=out>C:\Windows\system32</span> and so on down the list.  You can either
		move the crux executable files into one of these directories already
		in your PATH, or you can add <span
		class=code><em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em></span> to PATH with this
		command.  (Remember to replace the word <em>&lt;install directory&gt;</em> with the
		actual location of your installation)</p> 
		<div class=code><code>
		  set PATH=%PATH%;&lt;install directory&gt;\bin;</code><br>
		</div>
		<p>The change to <span class=code>PATH</span> is only temporary.
		To make a permanent change to the path follow the following steps:
		<ol>
		<li>Open the "Control Panel".</li>
		<li>Click on "System and Security".</li>
		<li>Click on "Advanced System Settings" in the list on the left 
		(you may be asked to give an administrative password).
		<li>
		You'll  presented with a dialog box titled "System Properties".
		Click on the button labeled "Environment Variables".
		<li>
		You'll be presented with a new dialog box containing two list boxes: one for user
		environment variables, and one for system environment variables.
		Select the 
		<span class=code>PATH</span>
		variable in the system variables list, and click on the "Edit ..." button.
		<li>
		Add the full path to the directory containing the Crux executables to the 
		list of directories. Remember that each
		<span class=code>PATH</span>
		entry should end with a semi-colon.
		</ol>
