  <p style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:
Helvetica;'>6.1 As
    Licensor delivers the software for free, Licensor is not liable for any kind of
    damage, direct or indirect, which may arise due to simple negligence (Section
    521 German Civil Code). In the event, that there should be &#8211; for whatever

    Terms Applicable to <span class=SpellE>CompassXtract</span></span></b></p>
  <p style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:
Helvetica;'>7.1 <span
class=SpellE>CompassXtract</span> is licensed, not sold. This License only
    gives you some rights to use <span class=SpellE>CompassXtract</span> and the <span
class=SpellE>CompassXtract</span> Libraries; the Licensor reserves all other
    rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,
    you may use <span class=SpellE>CompassXtract</span> and the <span class=SpellE>CompassXtract</span> Libraries only as expressly permitted in this License.</span></p>
  <p style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:
Helvetica;'>7.2 Licensor
    has no obligation to fix, update, supplement or support <span class=SpellE>CompassXtract</span> and/or the <span class=SpellE>CompassXtract</span> Libraries.</span></p>
  <p style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:
Helvetica;'>7.3 Your
    rights under this License terminate automatically if you breach this License in
    any way. Termination of this License will not affect any of your obligations or
    liabilities arising prior to termination. The following sections of this
    License shall survive termination: 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.1<span

    waived in writing only.</span></p>
  <p style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:
Helvetica;'>7.5 This
    Agreement is governed by German law to the exclusion of the UN Convention on
    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. If you are a consumer, this does
    not apply if legal provisions, in particular consumer protection legislation,
    conflict with this choice. The courts of Bremen shall have exclusive
    jurisdiction. If you are not a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a
    public-law special fund in the sense Section 38 of the German Code of Civil
    Procedure (ZPO), the <span class=GramE>agreement on the place of jurisdiction
    is replaced by the legal provisions</span>.</span></p>
  <p style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:

    individual provisions of this Agreement are or become invalid or contain a <span
class=GramE>gap which</span> needs to be filled, the validity of the remaining
    provisions of the Agreement will not be affected thereby. The Parties hereby
    undertake to substitute the invalid or lacking provision with a valid <span
class=GramE>provision which</span> comes closest to the documented intentions
    of the Parties.</span></p>
