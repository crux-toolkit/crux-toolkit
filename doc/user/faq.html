    <h2>Crux Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <ol>

    <li>
    <b>What is the difference between Tide and Comet?</b></li>

    <p>
    The differences are as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>
    Tide converts your FASTA file to an index (either as part
    of <code>tide-search</code> or by using <code>tide-index</code>),
    whereas Comet does searching directly from the FASTA file.  The
    indexing step allows Tide to pre-compute many parts of the search
    procedure, thereby making the search faster.
    <li>
    For each match, Comet reports the <i>total</i> number of candidate
    peptides, whereas Tide reports the number of <i>distinct</i> candidate
    peptides.</li>
    <li>
    Comet provides an option to report an E-value in addition to the raw
    XCorr score, whereas Tide provides an option to report a p-value.  The
    methods for computing these two statistical confidence measures are
    quite different.</li>
    <li>
    Some options are available only in Comet (various options related to
    different types of theoretical fragment ions, max_fragment_charge,
    nucleotide_reading_frame, etc.) whereas others are only available in
    Tide (e.g., keep-terminal-aminos).</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>
    Overall, for a given set of spectra, the XCorr scores computed by
    Comet and by Tide should be quite similar to one another, assuming
    that the various search parameters are set similarly between the two
    algorithms.  Below is a table summarizing the correspondence between
    the two sets of parameters.  The specified values will yield nearly
    identical XCorr scores from the two search engines.</p>

    <b>What operating systems does Crux work with?</b></li>

    <p>
    Crux is written in C++, so in principle it should work on virtually
    any modern operating system.  We provide pre-compiled binaries for
    Linux, MacOS and Windows.</p>

    <li><b>When I try to run Crux on my Linux system I get error messages like:</b>
    <pre>
    /tmp/crux: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.8' not found (required by /tmp/crux)
    /tmp/crux: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found (required by /tmp/crux)
    /tmp/crux: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found (required by /tmp/crux)p
    </pre>
    <br/> Crux depends on the C and C++ runtime libraries; however,
    newer versions of the runtime libraries are not backwards
    compatible with older versions.  We build the Linux binary
    distributions for Crux using GCC 4.9.  If your Linux system dates
    from before GCC 4.9 was available, then it may have versions of
    the runtime library that are incompatible with the Crux binary
    distribution.  In this case, you might consider updating your
    operating system.  Alternatively, you can build Crux from the
    source code distribution.  To build Crux from source you'll ned to
    install the C/C++ development tools, and CMake.  This can
    conveniently be done using <code>yum</code> <br/>
    <pre>
    sudo su -
    yum group install "Development Tools"
    yum install cmake
    </pre>
    <br/>
    Then follow the instructions in the in the 
    <a href="tutorials/install.html#src_build">installation tutorial</a>.

    <li>
    <b>How does Crux compute the masses of peptides and peptide
      fragments?</b></li>

    <p>
    <ul>

    <li>
    Each amino acid can be characterized either by its monoisotopic mass,
    which is the mass of the most abundant isotopic form of that amino acid,
    or the average mass, which is a weighted average of the masses of all
    the isotopic forms.  By default, Crux uses average mass to calculate
    peptide masses, though this behavior can be controlled by the
    <code>isotopic-mass</code> option to <code>tide-index</code> and the
    <code>mass_type_parent</code> option to <code>comet</code>.  For
    fragments, <code>tide-search</code> always uses the monoisotopic mass,
    whereas <code>comet</code> allows selection
    via <code>mass_type_fragment</code>.</li>

    <li>
    The neutral mass of a peptide is not the sum of the masses of its
    amino acids.  The N-terminus and C-terminus of the peptide together
    contribute an additional water molecule, whose mass is either
    18.010564684 Da (monoisotopic) or 18.0153 Da (average).</li>
    <li>
    A charged peptide has an additional approximately 1 Da mass for each
    charge, corresponding to the mass of a hydrogen atom.  The exact mass
    to be added depends on whether we are using the monoisotopic mass
    (1.007825035) or average mass (1.00794).</li>

    <li>When a peptide fragments, each b-ion will have a mass equal to
    the sum of its amino acids plus one hydrogen for each charge on the
    fragment, while each y-ion will have a mass equal to the sum of its
    amino acids plus water plus one hydrogen for each charge on the
    fragment.</li>

    <li>
    By default, both Tide and Comet add a static modification of
    57.021464 Da to all cysteines.  This is because in most protein
    preparation protocols the peptides are alkylated with iodoacetamide,
    resulting in carbamidomethylation of cysteine. The alkylation step
    prevents the reformation of disulfide bonds.  Other alykylation
    reagents may be used, in which case the appropriate mass shift can be
    specified with the <code>C=[mass]</code> option
    to <code>tide-index</code> or the <code>add_C_cysteine</code> option
    to <code>comet</code>.</li>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <li>
    <b>How does Crux assign fragment masses to bins prior to computing
    the XCorr score?</b>
    </li>

    <p>The XCorr score is essentially a dot product between a preprocessed
    form of the observed spectrum and the theoretical spectrum derived
    from the candidate peptide. In order to compute this dot product, the
    masses of the fragments in both spectra are assigned to discrete mass
    bins. This can be viewed as a form of rounding, but with more control
    over the discrete masses. Two parameters, <code>mz-bin-width</code> and
    <code>mz-bin-offset</code>, control the size and location of the bins,
    and are used to convert fragment masses according to this formula:</p>

    <p align=center>binned mass = floor( ( original mass / <code>bin-width</code> ) + 1.0 - <code>bin-offset</code> )</p>

    <p>
    The default values <code>bin-width</code>=1.0005079
    and <code>bin-offset</code>=0.40 are suitable for most low-resolution
    datasets.
    </p>

    <li>
    <b>How does Crux estimate the possible charge states of the peptides when the
       information is not provided within the spectra file?</b>
    </li>

    <p>
    Crux calculates the ratio of two values: (1) the sum of the
    intensities from the peaks in the fragmentation spectrum whose m/z is
    greater than the precursor m/z versus (2) the sum of the peaks whose
    m/z is smaller than the precursor.  If this ratio is greater than or
    equal to a calculated threshold based upon the location of the
    precursor m/z and the max m/z in the spectrum, Crux then assigns both
    +2 and +3 as possible charge states to the spectrum.  Otherwise, Crux
    assigns +1 as the charge state.  The algorithm is based upon the
    observation that fragmentation spectra collected from +1 peptides
    should have no peaks above the precursor m/z.  In contrast, a peptide
    of charge state greater than +1 can generate fragment ions of lower
    charge whose m/z is greater than the precursor m/z, thus indicating a
    multiply charged precursor.</p>

    <p>
    Note that, in addition, <code>comet</code> includes
    a <code>precursor_charge</code> parameter.  If the first number in
    this parameter is set to 0, i.e., <code>precursor_charge = 0 0</code>,
    then the charge state rule above is applied.  However, if a user
    specifies a precursor charge range, i.e., <code>precursor_charge = 1
    5</code>, then Comet will search every spectrum through this range of
    assumed charge states for every spectrum whose precursor charge
    is unknown.</p>

    <li>
    <b>How does Crux create peptides from the given set of proteins in the
      database?</b></li>

    <p>
    The options <code>enzyme</code> (for <code>tide-index</code>)
    and <code>search_enzyme_number</code> (for <code>comet</code>) define
    the enzymatic cleavage rules.  When <code>enzyme=no-enzyme</code>
    or <code>search_enzyme_number=0</code>, then any subsequence of a
    protein may be considered as a candidate peptide. For other values of
    these parameters, the residues at the termini of the protein
    subsequence must follow specific rules.  For example, trypsin requires
    that the preceeding residue must be an R or K and the following
    residue may not be a P.</p>

    <p>
    When <code>digestion=full-digest</code> (for <code>tide-index</code>)
    or <code>num_enzyme_termini=2</code> (for <code>comet</code>), then
    these rules must be true at both ends of the peptide.  When it
    is <code>digestion=partial-digest</code>
    or <code>num_enzyme_termini=1</code>, then the rules must be true at
    at least one of the ends.  The <code>missed-cleavages</code>
    and <code>allowed_missed_cleavages</code> parameters control the
    maximum number of cleavage sites that may lie within the peptide
    sequence.</p>

    <p>
    Note that if <code>enzyme=no-enzyme</code>
    or <code>search_enzyme_number=0</code>, then
    the <code>digestion</code>, <code>num_enzyme_termini</code>, <code>missed-cleavages</code>
    and <code>allowed_missed_cleaveages</code> parameters are not used.</p>


    <li>
    <b>How does Crux select candidate peptides from the database?</b></li>

    <p>
    The Crux search tools (<code>tide-index</code> and <code>comet</code>)
    select candidate peptides for each spectrum based on its precursor
    singly charged mass (m+h) or the mass-to-charge (m/z) and an assumed
    charge state (specified in the input file).  If the m+h and charge is
    provided in the input file (e.g., from the Z lines of an MS2 file),
    then the precursor mass is calculated from the m+h minus the mass of a
    proton. Otherwise, the precursor mass is calculated from the precursor
    m/z and an assumed charge.  A mass window is defined in one of three
    ways based on the
    <code>precursor-window-type</code> and <code>precursor-window</code>
    options.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>  
    If the <code>precursor-window-type</code> is set to <code>mz</code>,
    then the window is calculated as spectrum precursor m/z &plusmn;
    <code>precursor-window</code> and the resulting range is converted
    to mass using the charge state with the formula:<br>  
    Mass=m/z * charge - MASS_PROTON * charge, where MASS_PROTON=1.00727646677
    </li>

    <li>
    If the <code>precursor-window-type</code> is set to <code>mass</code>, then
    the window is defined as the precursor mass &plusmn; 
    <code>precursor-window</code>.
    </li>

    <li>
    If the <code>precursor-window-type</code> is set to <code>ppm</code>
    (parts per million), then the window spans from the precursor mass /
    (1.0 + window * 1e-6) to precursor mass / (1.0 - window * 1e-6).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Candidate peptides are those whose mass falls within the defined
    window.  The peptide mass is computed as the sum of the average amino
    acid masses plus 18 Da for the terminal OH group.  Candidate peptides
    can also be constrained by minimum and maximum allowed length. </p>

    <li>
    <b>How do Tide and Comet handle combinations of static and
    variable modifications, as well as n-terminal
    modifications?</b></li>

    <p>
    Although the syntax for specifying amino acid modifications
    differs between Comet and Tide, the logic of how those
    modifications are applied is similar.</p>

    <p>
    First, it's important to understand that the search tools support
    several different types of modifications.  A static modification
    is one that applies to every occurrence of an amino acid, whereas
    a variable modification means that the amino acid can occur in
    either form (modified or unmodified). Furthermore, unlike standard
    modifications that occur on amino acid side-chains, a terminal
    modification is applied to the molecular group at the N- or
    C-terminus of a peptide or protein. Typically, protein terminal
    modifications correspond to biological events, whereas peptide
    terminal modifications (which by definition must be applied after
    enzymatic digestion) are produced by the experimental
    workflow.</p>

    <p>
    Conceptually, all static modifications (standard ones and terminal
    ones) are applied first. Thereafter, variable modifications are
    applied on top of static modifications.  Any side-chain or
    terminus can harbor at most one variable modification and one
    static modification. Hence, it is an error to (try to) specify two
    different static modifications for the same type of residue, but
    perfectly legal to specify multiple variable modifications for the
    same residue.</p>

    <p>
    In the search engine output, you will see the unmodified peptide
    (e.g., K[-16.9981]VLGHIR in Comet's "plain_peptide" column) and
    the peptide with variable modifications indicated in brackets
    (e.g., K[-16.9981]VLGHIR in Comet's "peptide" column and Tide's
    "sequence" column). The full set of modifications (including
    static modifications) is specified as a comma-separated list in
    the "modifications" column, like this:
    1_S_45.0294,1_S_45.0239_n,1_V_-16.9981.  This specification
    indicates that the first amino acid has a standard static
    modification of 45.0294 as well as a static n-terminal
    modification of 45.0239.  In addition, the same residue has a
    variable modification of -16.9981.</p>

    <p>
    Note that Comet allows slightly more flexibility than Tide in
    specifying different types of modifications.  Terminal
    modifications in Comet can be specified to occur within a range of
    amino acids near the terminus.  Also, via the "binary set" flag, a
    modification can be required to appear on all or none of the
    residues in a given peptide.</p>

    <li>
    <b>What happens if I decrease the size of the precursor window during
    searching?</b></li>

    <p>
    Reducing the precursor mass tolerance has two main benefits.  One is
    reduced search time, and the other is improved statistical power to
    detect matches.  With a smaller window, fewer candidates are tested
    against a spectrum.  As a result, the statistical confidence measure
    calculated after multiple testing correction will be more significant.
    Of course, the flipside is that if you make the precursor window too
    small, then you may end up throwing out correct identifications.
    Control over the size of the window is provided by the using
    the <code>precursor-window</code> and
    <code>precursor-window-type</code> options.</p>

    <li>
    <b>How can I run many jobs in parallel?</b></li>


      <p>
    In combination with GNU parallel, parallelization of Crux can be
    achieved rather painlessly. For example, to run tide-search on a set
    of spectrum files, you can just get your spectra files into a filelist:</p>

    <pre>
find . -name "*.mzXML" &gt; file.list
    </pre>

    <p>
    Then, with a bit of bash magic, run parallel as follows (assuming
    there are 100 files in file.list):</p>

    <pre>
parallel --xapply crux tide-search &lt;options&gt; --fileroot {1} {2} database.db ::: $(seq 1 100) ::: $(cat file.list)
    </pre>

    <li>
    <b>How can I search my isotopically labeled data with Tide or Comet?</b></li>
    <p>
    Isotopically labeled data is accommodated by specifying various static or
    variable modifications. The specific types of modifications differ according
    to the labeling scheme, and the syntax for specifying the modifications
    differs between Tide (which uses options like <code>--mods-spec</code>) and
    Comet (which uses options like <code>add_Nterm_peptide</code>). In each of
    the following entries, we provide first the Tide options, followed by the
    Comet options.</p>
    <p style="color: #00f;">iTRAQ 4-plex:</p>
    <p><code>
    --mods-spec K+144.10253 --nterm-peptide-mods-spec X+144.10253</code></p>
    <p><code>
    add_Nterm_peptide = 144.10253<br>
    add_K_lysine = 144.10253<br>
    clear_mz_range = 113.5 117.5</code></p>
    <p>
    The 4-plex reagent has different  monoisotopic mass values for 114
    (144.105918), 115 (144.09599), and 116/117 (144.102063).  The mass value
    used above is derived from averaging the three monoisotopic masses.</p>
    <p style="color: #00f;">iTRAQ 8-plex:</p>
    <p><code>
    --mods-spec K+304.2022 --nterm-peptide-mods-spec X+304.2022</code></p>
    <p><code>
    add_Nterm_peptide = 304.2022<br>
    add_K_lysine = 304.2022<br>
    clear_mz_range = 112.5 121.5</code></p>
    <p>
    The mass modification above is the average of the two different set of
    masses for 115/118/119/121 (304.199040) and 113/114/116/117
    (304.205360).</p>

    <p style="color: #00f;">SILAC 4Da:</p>
    <p>
    There are a number of different SILAC reagents with a ~4 Da modification
    (based on combinations of C13 and N15), each with different sites of
    specificity.  The example below is for the 15N(4) reagent applied to R
    residues.  You should adjust the modification mass and residue(s) applied
    to as necessary.</p>
    <p>
    To perform a mixed light/heavy search using a variable modification
    search:</p>
    <p><code>
    --mods-spec 3R+3.988140</code></p>
    <p><code>
    variable_mod01 = 3.988140 R 1 3 -1 0 0</code></p>
    <p>
    Note that, in the example above, Comet operates in “binary” mode, which
    means that it only considers peptides in which all or none of the lysine
    residues are light/heavy. Tide does not support binary mode searching, so it
    will consider all peptides with up to 3 (in the above specification) heavy
    lysines.</p>
    <p>
    To search just the heavy labeled sample, you can apply a static
    modification:</p>
    <p><code>
    --mods-spec R+3.988140</code></p>
    <p><code>
    add_K_lysine = 3.988140</code></p>
    <p style="color: #00f;">SILAC 6Da:</p>
    <p>
    This example uses the 13C(6) SILAC mass, assuming it is applied to both K
    and R. You should adjust as necessary.  There is at least one more SILAC
    reagent with ~6 Da modification mass and different residue specificity:
    13C(5) 15N(1)</p>
    <p>
    To perform a mixed light/heavy search using a variable modification:</p>
    <p><code>
    --mods-spec 3KR+6.020129</code></p>
    <p><code>
    variable_mod01 = 6.020129 KR 1 3 -1 0 0</code></p>
    <p>
    To search just the heavy labeled sample, you can apply a static
    modification:</p>
    <p><code>
    --mods-spec KR+6.020129</code></p>
    <p><code>
    add_K_lysine = 6.020129<br>
    add_R_arginine = 6.020129</code></p>
    <p style="color: #00f;">SILAC 8Da:</p>
    <p>
    The example below is for 13C(6) 15N(2) on K residues. Variable modification
    search:</p>
    <p><code>
    --mods-spec 3K+8.014199</code></p>
    <p><code>
    variable_mod01 = 8.014199 K 1 3 -1 0 0</code></p>
    <p>
    Static modification for just the heavy labeled search:</p>
    <p><code>
    --mods-spec K+8.014199</code></p>
    <p><code>
    add_K_lysine = 8.014199</code></p>


<p style="color: #00f;">100% 15N label:</p>

<p>
  The N15 labeling adds 0.997035 mass difference for every nitrogen in
  each amino acid.  So for a 100% N15 analysis, specify a static
  modification (between 1 and 4) to every amino acid residue, like
  this:</p>
