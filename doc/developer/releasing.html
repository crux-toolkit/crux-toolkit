 <h2 align=center>Notes on releasing new versions of Crux</h2>

<h2>
We used to use TeamCity as our build system.
This has been replaced by a 
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml">GitHub Action</a>
running whenever a commit is made to the <code>master</code>
branch of the Crux repository.
Intermediate builds are now released automatically, as described
in 
<a href="crux-website.html">How to administer the Crux website</a>.
</h2>
<h2>
<p><i>Note: A detailed <a href=#todo>checklist</a> is at the bottom of
    this page</i>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
After every successful commit to the Crux GitHub repository
GitHub actions automatically publishes the current source distribution
and binaries for all platforms to the Crux web site.
As functionality milestones are achieved
we also publish stable, versioned releases.
This document describes how to publish a versioned release.

<h3>Before you begin</h3>
<p>Consider updating the UNIMOD data: download the latest data in XML format from
  <code>http://www.unimod.org/xml/unimod.xml</code>. Then, run <code>bin/unimod_parser.py
  /path/to/xml/file &gt; src/model/Unimod.h.</code>

<p>Confirm that GitHub Actions successfully built Crux from the current
  repository trunk on all platforms, and that the smoke and performance tests all 
  passed on the 64-bit Linux build.
  Update the release notes
  (<code>doc/user/release-notes.html</code>), and update the PHP script to point at the
  new packages (<code>doc/user/download/download.php</code>).

<h3>Version numbers</h3>
<p>Each time new files are made available for download, the version
number should increment by 0.01 for minor releases or by 0.1 for major
releases. The version number is maintained in CMakeLists.txt in the
root Crux directory in the lines
<pre>
set (CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "X")
set (CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "XX")
</pre>
This controls the numbering of packages and what is reported by the 
<code>--version</code> option.
</p>
<p>Update <code>doc/user/download/download.php</code> to point at the new
versions of the distribution packages.</p>
<p>Commit these changes to the trunk.</p>

<h3>Create a branch for the release</h3>
<p>
Because each numbered release of Crux will require some changes to the source,
a branch should be created for each release.
Bugs in the release are fixed in this branch and then
merged into the default branch.
<p/>
For example:
<pre>
# Get latest code from remote origin
git pull
# Create branch for bug fixes to release
git checkout -b crux-3.2
</pre>
<h3>Updating the tarball of the Proteowizard source</h3>
The default build of Crux uses a cached version of Proteowizard 
stored at 
<a href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/crux-downloads">http://noble.gs.washington.edu/crux-downloads</a>
It may be neccesary to update this tar ball occasionally.
<p/>
The script <code>ext/download-pwiz-tarball.sh</code>
can be used to download a copy of the Proteowizard source tarball
into the current directory.
It can then be copied into the download directory for the new release on the
<code>crux-toolkit</code> download web site, which is on
<code>noble-web</code> on the GS network.
The Crux download directory is under the Noble Lab website,
in <code>/noble/www/htdocs/crux-downloads</code>.
<p/>
The Crux build will then need to be modiefied to use the new 
Proteowizard tarball.</h3>
This is done by editing <code>ext\CMakeLists.txt.</code>
Look for blocks of code  in the clauses depending
on <code>USE_LATEST_PWIZ</code>.
Change these blocks to point to the new Proteowizard tarball on the Crux web site.
<h3>Modify the Crux build to use a updated version of Percolator</h3>
In <code>ext/CMakeLists.txt</code> set the CMake varible <code>PERCOLATOR_GIT_VERSION</code>
to the tag for the current release of Percolator.
For example:
<pre>
SET(PERCOLATOR_GIT_VERSION "rel-3-02")
</pre>
<h3>Update the .github/workflows/main.yml as needed for the new version</h3>
Update the name of the packages generated in the build.
For example, change <code>crux-4.1.Darwin.x86_64.zip</code>
to <code>crux-4.2.Darwin.x86_64.zip</code>.
<h3>Commit the changes to the release branch</h3>
When you are satisfied with your updates to the new release branch,
commit and push to GitHub. On GitHub manually trigger the action main.yml
for the branch. This will trigger a build for each platform and,
run the smoke tests on Linux. It won't update the Crux web site.
If the builds and smoke tests were all successful,
obtain a code review for your changes.
<h3>Merge the changes from the release branch into the main branch</h3>
Once the code review has been approved merge the changes from the
release branch into the main branch. This will trigger another
build and re-run the smoke tests, but now if these are successful
the Crux web site will be updated. However, the distribution files
for each platform will need to be put in the proper directory
on the Crux download server.
<h3>Update the Crux download server (<code>noble-web</code>)</h3>
Crux downloads are stored on the <a
href="https://noble.gs.washington.edu/crux-downloads">Noble lab web server</a>.
The distributions are stored in
<code>noble-web:/noble/www/htdocs/crux-downloads</code>.
Create a new subdirectory for the release and
copy the new distribution for each platform from 
<code>noble-web:/noble/htdocs/crux-downloads/daily</code>
into the directory for the new release, dropping the Git commit hash from the
name.
Once the download page on the <a href="https://crux.ms">main Crux web site</a>
has been updated by the GitHub actions, you should be able to download
these distributions from the <a href="https://crux.ms/download.html">download
page</a>.
You should download and test the distribution for each platform.

<h3>Checklist</h3></a>
<p>Here is a list of steps to follow, roughly in this order</p>
<ol>
<h4>Preliminaries</h4>
<li>Change version number in <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> in the project root.
<li>Review the <code>git</code> commit log since the last release and update
the release notes accordingly.</li>
<li>Update <code>doc/user/download/download.php</code> to point at the new
versions of the distribution packages.</li>
<li>Check that the current trunk builds correctly for all platforms.</li>
<li>Check that the smoke test for the current trunk run correctly for 64-bit Linux</li>
<li>Commit changes to the trunk.</li>
<h4>Create new version branch and Proteowizard tarball</h4>
<li>Create a branch in the GitHub repository for the new version</li>
<li>Check out a clean copy of the branch for the version.</li>
<li>Create a tarball of the current version of Proteowizard and store a copy 
in the download directory of the Crux web site.</li>
<li>Update the <code>ext/CMakeLists.txt</code> script to point at the
Proteowizard tarball you just created.</li>
<li>Update the <code>ext/CMakeLists.txt</code> script with the
<code>PERCOLATOR_GIT_TAG</code> for the current release of Percolator.</li>
<h4>Check that the release branch builds and smoke tests pass</h4>
<li>Commit changes to the branch.
<li>Check results of GitHub action builds and smoke tests.
<li>If the builds and smoke tests were successfull obtain a code review.</li>
<li>Once the code review is approved, merge the release branch into
the main branch. This will trigger another build, but this time
the Crux web site will be updated.</li>
<li></li>
<h4>Copy the distribution files to the Noble labe web server.</h4>
<li>Create a new directory for the distributions in
<code>noble-web:/noble/htdocs/crux-downloads</code></li>
<li>Copy the new distribution for each platform from 
<code>noble-web:/noble/htdocs/crux-downloads/daily</code>
into the directory for the new release, droping the Git commit hash from the
name.</li>
<li>Download, unpack, and build Crux from the source file tarball from the web site.
<li>Download, unpack and run the binary files from the web site.  <i>You may want to ask someone
    else to do these steps on different computers.</i>
<li>Test that the links all work (use the <a
href="https://validator.w3.org/checklink">W3 Link Validator</a>).
<li>Send a message to the crux users list announcing the new release.
</ol>
