<h1>Crux tests</h1>

<p>
A collection of four types of tests resides under src/c/test, each in
their own appropriately named subdirectory.  The makefile offers
targets for compiling or running various tests.</p>

<h3>Smoke tests</h3>

<p>
These tests should be run before any update is committed to SVN.  Note
that you do have to run them on a 64-bit machine using 64-bit versions
of crux. You also need to run the tests with a version of crux
compiled in release mode (<code>cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
.</code>).  This is because the existing test result files were built
on a 64-bit machine in release mode.</p> 

<p>
To run the tests, <a href="https://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> must be
installed. GSIT has made it available as a module, so running "module
load cucumber/latest" will work. Instructions for installing Cucumber
on Mac OS can be
found <a href="http://watirmelon.com/2010/12/09/how-to-set-up-cucumber-and-watir-on-osx/">here</a>.
Once Cucumber is available, the tests are run by executing the command
"cucumber features/&lt;feature file&gt;" from the <code>
test/smoke-tests</code> directory. This will run the set of tests in
the specified feature file. If no feature file is specified (i.e. just
running the command "cucumber"), all feature files in
the <code>features</code> directory are used.
</p>

<p>
Test output for a scenario will show up in green if it passes. If the scenario
fails to pass, the step that failed will show up in red and an error will be
printed.
</p>

<p>
The actual tests, located in the <code>test/smoke-tests/features</code>
directory, are in feature files organized by application. For example, the
<code>tide-search.feature</code> file contains tests for tide-search. Each
feature file contains a set of scenarios in which parameters are specified and
then the application's output is compared to a known good result (located in the
<code>good_results</code> directory). If the output does not match, it is
written to a file called <code>&lt;expected results&gt;.observed</code>.
</p>

<p>
To update all test results, run the <code>update-cucumber-tests.sh</code> script
from the smoke-tests directory.
</p>

<p>
Scenarios are written in plain English, which are parsed using regular
expressions into testing instructions according to the definitions in <code>
features/step_definitions/SmokeTestStepDefinitions.rb</code>. While the step
definition file parses the scenarios, most of the actual testing code is in
<code>features/support/CruxTester.rb</code>. Both of these files are written in
Ruby.
</p>

<p>
  To add a new test to an existing command, do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Find in the
    directory <code>test/smoke-tests/features/</code>
    the <code>*.feature</code> file that corresponds to your
    command.</li>
    <li>
    In the "Examples:" portion at the end of the file, add a new
    line to define your test.  The meanings of the various fields
    (delimited by "|") are listed immediately below the "Examples:"
    line.</li>
  <li>
    If necessary, copy your input files into
    the <code>smoke-tests</code> directory.  In many cases, you can
    re-use existing input files from other tests.</li>
  <li>
    Create a new parameter file in the <code>params</code> directory
    that includes the parameters for your test.</li>
  <li>
    Run the command corresponding to your test and check that the
    results make sense.</li>
  <li>
    Decide which output file you want the test to look at. Write the
    name of that file in the "actual_output" field. Make a copy
    of the file, with a name of your choice, in the "good_results"
    directory, and then write that name in the "expected_output"
    field.</li>
  <li>
    Run cucumber to ensure that your new test passes.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Unit Tests</h3>

<p>
Unit tests for individual components of <code>crux</code> are
in <code>crux/src/c/test/unit-tests</code>
and <code>crux/src/c/test/cppunit-tests</code>.  We are in the process
of a transition from C to C++ so new unit tests should be added to the
cppunit-tests directory.  A good time to add new unit tests is when a
new class is created or new method is added to an existing class.  
These tests must be compiled any time there are changes made to the
code.  Run <code>make check-unit-tests</code> and 
<code>make check-cpp-unit-tests</code> from the test directory or
run <code>make</code> from each sub-directory.  As the tests run,
the results will be printed to stdout.</p>

<p>
Tests are arranged by source file with
<code>check-&lt;filename&gt;.c</code> or 
<code>Test&lt;Filename&gt;.cpp</code> containing tests for 
methods in <code>crux/src/c/&lt;filename&gt;.cpp</code>.  The main
drivers are <code>crux-unit-tests.c</code> and <code>main.cpp</code>.
</p>

<p>
Information about the <code>check</code> package
is <a href="http://check.sourceforge.net/">here</a> and a very basic
tutorial starts
<a href="http://check.sourceforge.net/doc/check.html/check_5.html#SEC5">here</a>.  
Information about the <code>cppunit</code> package is <a 
href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppunit/index.php?title=Main_Page">
here</a> and from that main page are links to the <a href=
"http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/doc/lastest/index.html">documentation</a>
that includes a nice step-by-step tutorial.
</p>

<p>
The unit testing is not complete.  Chris set up many tests as he was
starting out, but eventually abandoned them.  By the time Barbara
encountered the code, very few of the tests still worked.  Those she
could fix quickly were kept and the rest were commented out
of <code>crux-unit-tests.c</code>.  A number of new tests were added
as the dynamic modifications were being implemented.  As structs are
converted to classes, more tests are being added to cppunit-tests.</p>

<p>
To see the basic structure of the <code>check-</code> files look
at <code>check-template.c</code>.  There are a series of short tests,
each with a name.  Before each test, a setup routine is run to create
data structures.  A teardown routine is run after each test to clean up
any memory allocated in the setup.  Tests can be performed on those
objects created in setup or on locally created values.  The basic form
of the test is to call a method and check the value it returned
with <code>fail_unless(condition, message)</code>.  As soon as one of
these statements fails, the message is printed, the test ends, the
teardown routine is called, and the next test is started.  
</p>

<p>
To add a new test to an existing file, insert a new <code>
START_TEST(name){}END_TEST</code> block into the file and add the test to the
test suite using <code>tcase_add_test()</code>.  To create a new test
suite, make a copy of <code>check-template.c</code> and fill in the
body of the tests, changing &lt;&lt;class&gt;&gt; to the name of
crux/src/c/ file. Make a copy of <code>check-template.h</code> and
change the names accordingly.  Look for &lt;&lt;class&gt;&gt;
in <code>crux-unit-tests.c</code> and add a line of that form with the
correct name.  Finally, add the name of the file to <code>Makefile</code>. 
</p>

<p>
The basic structure of the cppunit tests is very similar and the 
<code>TestTemplate.cpp</code> file can be used as a starting point for
additional tests.</p>

<h3>Performance tests</h3>

<p>
These tests measure, for a given data set, how well the various Crux
search tools work.  The measurement uses decoy PSMs as an empirical
null distribution.  A full description is
available <a href="../../test/performance-tests/performance.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Calibration tests</h3>

<p>
These tests measure, for a given data set, the extent to which the
p-value produced by <code>crux search-for-matches</code> are uniformly
distributed when the input database is shuffled.  A full description
is
available <a href="../../test/calibration/calibration.html">here</a>.</p>
